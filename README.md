# FarmTrade
I developed a farmersâ€™ mobile app using Java in Android Studio with Firebase backend, offering crop info, weather updates, and a marketplace. Implemented secure login, real-time data sync, notifications, and search features, enhancing my Java, Android, and cloud integration skills while solving real farming challenges.
